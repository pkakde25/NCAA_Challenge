## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Data

### Training Data
- The training data should be in CSV format and include features relevant to predicting customer activities.
- Example columns might include customer demographics, transaction history, etc.

### Test Data
- The test data should follow the same format as the training data for consistency in preprocessing and prediction.

## Preprocessing

### Steps:
1. **Date Parsing**: Convert date columns to datetime format.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on the parsed dates.
3. **Encoding**: Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding as necessary.
4. **Standardization**: Standardize numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance.

Example preprocessing code:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Define your preprocessing steps
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', StandardScaler(), numerical_features),
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(), categorical_features)
    ]
)
```

## Modeling

### Model Used
- **XGBoost Classifier**: An efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework.

Example model code:

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

model = XGBClassifier(
    use_label_encoder=False,
    eval_metric='mlogloss',
    random_state=0,
    **best_params
)
```

### Training Pipeline

A pipeline is created to streamline preprocessing and modeling:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('model', model)
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Evaluation

### Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize the performance of the classification model.

Example evaluation code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
```

## Prediction

### Making Predictions on New Data

```python
# Preprocess the test data
test_data_preprocessed = preprocessor.transform(test_data)

# Make predictions
predictions = pipeline.predict(test_data_preprocessed)
```

## Submission

### Preparing the Submission File

```python
submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'RecordID': test_data['RecordID'],
    'ActivityType': predictions
})

submission_df.to_csv('submission_file.csv', index=False)
```
